            <p>Warhammer 40,000 (also known as Warhammer 40K or simply 40K) is a tabletop wargame and fictional universe developed by Games Workshop. The setting takes place in the far future of the 41st millennium, where humanity has spread throughout the galaxy and is engaged in a constant struggle for survival against various hostile alien races, demonic entities, and other threats.</p>
            <p>The universe is characterized by a dark, gothic aesthetic, with a heavy emphasis on the use of technology and religious iconography. The primary faction of humanity is the Imperium of Man, a vast interstellar empire ruled by the immortal God-Emperor of Mankind. The Imperium is divided into countless sub-factions, each with their own unique culture and military forces.</p>
            <p>The primary antagonists of the Imperium are the forces of Chaos, which are led by powerful daemon princes and seek to corrupt and destroy all life in the galaxy. Other major factions include the Eldar, a dying race of psychic warriors; the Orks, a brutal and warlike race of alien mercenaries; the Necrons, an ancient race of mechanical beings; and the Tyranids, a swarm of ravenous alien creatures that consume everything in their path.</p>
